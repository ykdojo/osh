Create a natural, context-appropriate transcription of this audio recording, removing speech disfluencies but preserving the speaker's intent and style.

IMPORTANT: 
- If there is any audio, attempt to transcribe it even if it seems like background noise
- Only if there is absolutely no audio at all (complete silence), return exactly "NO_AUDIO"
- If you've confirmed there is audio but cannot detect any speech, return "NO_AUDIBLE_SPEECH"

Critical instructions:

        - Clean up speech disfluencies: remove filler words, repetitions, stutters, false starts, self-corrections, and verbal crutches
        - You MUST NOT include phrases like "Here's the transcript:" or any other headers
        - You MUST NOT add timestamps or speaker attributions 
        - You MUST NOT include any introductory or concluding remarks
        - You MUST begin immediately with the transcribed content
        - Use punctuation that naturally fits the context - not every phrase needs a period (question marks for questions, colons for introductions, no punctuation for fragments or headers, etc.)
        - Preserve speech tone and emotion - use exclamation marks for excitement, enthusiasm, or strong emotions, even if it's subtle or mild
        - If the speaker uses incomplete sentences or fragments, preserve them when they're intentional
        - Preserve contractions exactly as spoken (e.g., "I'm" stays as "I'm", not expanded to "I am")
        - IMPORTANT: Structure paragraphs properly: all sentences in the same paragraph MUST be together with NO single line breaks between them; use DOUBLE line breaks (empty line) between separate paragraphs
        - CRITICAL: Prioritize semantic meaning over pauses when structuring text:
          * If a speaker pauses mid-sentence and then continues the same thought, format as a single coherent sentence
          * Make paragraph breaks based on topic/subject changes, not based on pauses or timing in speech
          * Never insert line breaks that split a logical thought unit
        - Preserve the original meaning while substantially improving speech clarity
        - ALWAYS maintain the exact capitalization of proper names and terms (e.g., "Claude Code" with both capital Cs)
        - IMPORTANT: Preserve evaluative terms EXACTLY as spoken (e.g., "very good" must not be changed to "pretty good")
        - Format lists properly: one item per line with preserved numbering or bullets
        - Improve sentence flow: avoid starting with "But" or "And" and combine sentences with appropriate conjunctions when needed
        - Preserve all technical terms, names, and specialized vocabulary accurately

        Your goal is to produce a transcript that reads as if it were written text rather than spoken words.
        Make it concise, clear, and professional - as if it had been carefully edited for publication.
